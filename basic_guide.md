### Introduction phase:

- **Thanks for your willingness to talk**
- **author - Master Student at the University of Stuttgart - Master Thesis**
- **Topic: Identify requirements in the field of software integration testing with a focus on autonomous driving + look at problems, solution approaches**
- _**To begin with, could you describe what your role in the testing process is and how long you have been involved in integration testing**_

### Test Object -What?

**Can you describe on which of the big domain ECUs you are working/testing on?**
- How does software architecture of the "insert_ECU_name" look like (in terms of Adaptive stack, classic stack, non AUTOSAR stack)?
- Is the ECU a real-time critical system?
- In relation to the ASPICE process model, which process is your work assigned to?
- **On which aspect of integration testing (deployment, static or dynamic architecture, resources) do you focus on?**
  - If multiple: Which specific part of the architecture (your aspects) is most critical to test?
  - If multiple: How can the different aspects be prioritized?
- **In terms of your field/your work, what is the goal of testing?**

### Testing Methods - How?

**Which test methods are used at the moment to achieve the previously mentioned goals like ....?**
- If too many methodologies: Which are the most effective test methodologies?
- Does the test object need to be changed in order to apply the test methods, and if so, what needs to be changed?
- Are there dependencies on other teams (or external partners) that influence the use of this testing methods?
- **On which test driver are the test cases executed and to what extent does it differ from the target environment?**
  - Why are the test cases (not) executed directly on the target hardware?
  - Are there dependencies on other teams (or external partners) that influence the use of this testing methods?
- **Which norms and standards are relevant for the testing process how do they affect your work/ testing?**
  - How do you adapt your testing methods to meet the standards?
  - How do norms and standards affect the execution of test cases?

### Testing Issues - why not?

**Regarding your specific field of work, when is a test complete?**
- **What kind of (coverage) criteria is used, in order to measure completeness?**
  - What procedures do you follow to obtain high coverage of test cases and how much time does it take?
- **What are the most significant problems you face during testing (this might include technical challenges as well as resource limitations)**
  - What are the gaps in current testing frameworks or standards for AD?
  - (Are there any problems like ... in the past for which a solution has been found?)
- **What are possible approaches for the previously mentioned problems like ... ?**
  - Which factors (e.g. time) make it difficult to implement solutions?
  - Which people need to be approached for the implementation?
  - Are there dependencies on other teams (or external partners) that influence the use of this testing methods?

### Test automation

**Why is test automation important?**
- **Which test steps are automated and how is test automation implemented?**
  - Does the test object need to be changed to automate testing?
- **What are the challenges for automating all test steps?**
  - Is automation compatible with the use of previously mentioned tools/methods?
  - Is the automation of all test steps feasible in the near future and if not, what are the major challenges?
  - Are there dependencies on other teams (or external partners) that influence the use of test automation?
- **How are the test cases specified. Do you write them manually or is there a tool you can use to generate test cases?**

### Tools - with what?

**Which tools are used to document the requirements of the test object to be tested?**
- Can you explain the advantages and disadvantages of using the tool ... is?
- Who or which groups are involved in the selection of the tool?
- **Which tools do you use in the context of the above-mentioned test methods or for test case execution?**
  - Where does the use of the tool help and how does it simplify your work?
  - Can you explain the advantages and disadvantages of using the tool ... is?
  - Could you explain how to evaluate and select the tools?
- **How do you ensure the tools you use for testing are up to date and capable of handling the latest technology?**
- **What role do open-source tools play in your testing process for AD?**

### End of the interview

- **Thank you for your time**
- **Mediation of further contacts**
- **All in all, are there any points that are relevant from your point of view that we haven't discussed? Do you have anything else to add?**
